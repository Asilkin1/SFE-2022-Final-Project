An attempt to create a Wordle-like https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html game with a little twist.
## Getting Started


### Run development server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

### Create React Component

1. Visit /components/ folder
2. Create a react component with .tsx file extention(remember to export it)
3. In /pages/index.tsx import your component

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
